# Monterey Food Finder

## What it Does
This Flask app helps users decide where to eat in the Monterey Bay Area. Users select a cuisine, and the app will display a random restaurant that serves that cuisine and is currently open. It also pulls health inspection data for that restaurant from Monterey County, as well as displaying ratings, prices, and a Google Map of the restaurant.

## Who Built It
Built as the Final Project for Wes Modes' CST205 Multimedia Programming at California State University, Monterey Bay. The development team included Hector Lopez, Yazmin Carrillo, Edgar Licup, and Sutter Laird.
