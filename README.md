# Monterey Food Finder

## What it Does
    This Flask web app allows users to find restaurants in the Monterey Bay Area via two methods. The first involves choosing a particular genre of food and being presented with a randomly selected restaurant that is currently open. The second allows the user to filter restaurants by desired parameters.

## Who Built It
    Built as the Final Project for Wes Modes' CST205 Multimedia Programming at California State University, Monterey Bay.
